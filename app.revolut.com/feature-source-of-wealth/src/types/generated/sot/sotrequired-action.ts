/**
 * Source of Transaction
 * # Overview  Source of Transaction flow is used for allowing our users to verify flagged payers along with related transactions. The flow is triggered when AML models decide so.  # Api Workflow  ## What should happen when user has not submitted anything    1. `GET /user/current/submissions/states` returns `REQUIRED` for `sourceOfTransaction` flow therefore user should be presented with the submission.   1. `GET /user/current/submissions/sot/v6/config` returns payer names & transaction ids.   1. `GET /user/current/submissions/sot/v6/latest` return `404` code meaning that user has not submitted anything yet.   1. `GET /user/current/submissions/sot/v6/evidences/types` for fetching available income sources for the list & other metadata via this endpoint.   1. `POST /user/current/submissions/sot/v6/evidences` for creating evidence with user defined `type` and other parameters   1. `POST /user/current/submissions/sot/v6/evidences/{evidenceId}/documents` which uploads all the pages for documents  ## What should happen when user has submitted something but didn\'t finish    The same as in previous point but 2. step will have different outcome:   2. `GET /user/current/submissions/sot/v6/latest` returns submission state with previously created evidences & uploaded pages.
