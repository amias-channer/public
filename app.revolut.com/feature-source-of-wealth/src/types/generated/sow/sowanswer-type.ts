/**
 * Source of Wealth Flow
 * # Overview  Source of Wealth flow is used for allowing our users to verify they total topup. The flow is triggered when user exceedes topupLimit on Wallet or when RWFF system calculates risk score that exceedes the threshold.  When such situation happens, users are presented with the flow. If the SoW check is not important then they are presented with \'optional\' flow which they can do for 30 days, if they don\'t do it, the flow gets presented in the \'required\' form which creates a Soft Lock. Soft Lock prevents the user from topping up the account and sending money out, it does not prevent the user from using the app in a normal way.  # Api Workflow  ## What should happen when user has not submitted anything    1. `GET /user/current/submissions/states` returns `REQUIRED` for `sourceOfWealth` flow therefore user should be presented with the submission.   1. `GET /user/current/submissions/sow/v6/config` returns `totalTopup`, `defaultCurrency` and other flow related data that\'s not part of the submission.   1. `GET /user/current/submissions/sow/v6/latest` return `404` code meaning that user has not submitted anything yet.   1. `GET /user/current/submissions/sow/v6/evidences/types` for fetching available income sources for the list & other metadata via this endpoint.   1. `POST /user/current/submissions/sow/v6/evidences` for creating evidence with user defined `incomeSource` and other parameters   1. `POST /user/current/submissions/sow/v6/evidences/{evidenceId}/documents` which uploads all the pages for documents   1. `PUT /user/current/submissions/sow/v6/confirm-upload` for confirming that user is done and the submission is ready to be reviewed  ## What should happen when user has submitted something but didn\'t finish    The same as in previous point but 2. step will have different outcome:    2. `GET /user/current/submissions/sow/v6/latest` returns submission state with previously created evidences & uploaded pages.
